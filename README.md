# SwingJBehave

SwingJBehave is library of JBehave steps that provide reusable narrative for applying BDD to your Swing apps.

## Building

I have provided a buildr script for this purpose.
The binary is not yet provided anywhere on the web: I am using Sonatype Nexus to provide a local publishing mechanism for the artifact generated, but you can simply use:

    buildr clean install

to install the jar to your local .m2 directory.

## Ongoing development

At this point I am still in the process of getting myself setup to enable collaboration and will publish web site details and email addresses for issues to be reported in due course.

## Depended-on Technologies

JDK required: 5.0 (or above)
Ruby/JRuby & Buildr
JBehave
